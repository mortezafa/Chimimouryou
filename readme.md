## Chimimouryou (魑魅魍魎)

Chimimouryou is a Cli tool written in Golang to watch anime in your terminal. So far, Its quite basic in its funciontality but I plan on adding more features in the months to come. 

Chimimouryous only command so far is `chimi search`. Using this command will bring you to a search page where you can search
any anime of your choosing. After which you will be brough to various menus to choose your anime and episode.
